# minesweeper
for the course IntroAI
I couldn't test on fresh ubuntu but this should be all needed commands to get the application running

- install python3 

sudo apt install python3

- install pip3

sudo apt install python3-pip

- install z3

pip3 install z3-solver

- install numpy

pip3 install numpy


## Run the program

- go to folder final_submission (e.g. cd final_submission) if you downloaded from Moodle
or if you got it from GitHub etc go into the directory you saved the files into such that main.py is in the same hierarchical subdirectory.
- run python3 main.py


## Change grid sizes and solvers

- the main.py class contains comments for various sizes and solver which can be uncommented and commented as you wish for testing.
- if you want only one game run or more you can alter the variable nr_of_games
