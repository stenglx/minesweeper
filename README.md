# minesweeper
for the course IntroAI
I couldn't test on fresh ubuntu but this should be all needed commands to get the application running

- install python3 

sudo apt install python3

- install pip3

sudo apt install python3-pip

- install z3

pip3 install z3-solver

- install numpy

pip3 install numpy


## Run the program

- if you clone from Github go into the folder minesweeper
- if you downloaded from Moodle go into the downloaded folder (final_submission or final_submission_unzipped)

- run python3 main.py


## Change grid sizes and solvers

- the main.py class contains comments for various sizes and solver which can be uncommented and commented as you wish for testing.
- if you want only one game run or more you can alter the variable nr_of_games
